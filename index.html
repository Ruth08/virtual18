You can be contracted for one project (such as blog design) or it can be a continuing job such as replying to e-mails and comments.</font></p>
                 <p class="lead" style="font-weight: 200";><font size="3">Virtual Assistant services are popular nowadays because entrepreneurs, small business owners and startups save a lot of time and money through them. Particularly in demand are Executive Virtual Assistants. An Executive Virtual Assistant, or EVA, is a person who provides high-level administrative support to entrepreneurs or companies remotely or "virtually". They perform tasks and other details as dictated by the client through email, chat, fax, telephone, and any other way agreed upon. You can count on EVAs to deliver quality support to help your business meet its goals.</font></p>

                   <h3>What Does an Executive Virtual Assistant Do?</h3>
                   <p class="lead" style="font-weight: 200;"><font size="3">An Executive Virtual Assistant works “behind the scenes” virtually, providing office administration, customer relations, project management, writing expertise, presentation preparation, and much more. Various tasks that you need to accomplish on a daily basis such as replying to emails and answering phone calls, to arranging schedule and meetings are taken up by these expert assistants so you could focus on your expertise and shine. Because when you're being pulled in a million directions, having an EVA partner you can trust to help you get more things done is invaluable.</font></p>
